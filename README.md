# **Dynamic Pairwise Sequence Alignment Algorithm** 
<br>
<hr>
</div>

In this assignment, we implement dynamic pairwise sequence alignment algorithm. We use this program to align DNA sequences. DNA sequences is 
read from input file. We use gap and mismatch penalties, match scores while performing alignment. Our program finds the optimum alignment between 
the given sequences using the following scores. Default values for scores are as follows:

• match score: +3.
• mismatch score: -1.
• affine gap penalty: gap opening penalty: -1, gap extension penalty: -0.5.

To run<br>
</div>

* Install nodejs to your computer.
* Open the terminal and navigate to project folder.
* Run “node index.js” command.

Default input file name is "test1.seq". You can change this by assigning FILEPATH variable on the second line of the code, to your own input file name.
